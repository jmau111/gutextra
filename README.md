### 3rd block: Watermark

Add image with watermark. Pretty basic for now (kinda caption... ^^) but I've added tones of useless settings.
I mean not really useless... This allows you to choose position, image width, image height, color of copyright.

Just fun.

### 2nd block: Pie

Very basic chart pie with svg, allows you to control sizes, colors, text.

### 1rst block : Alerts

A classic one ! I've added some CSS bootstrap styles to make it very generic.
